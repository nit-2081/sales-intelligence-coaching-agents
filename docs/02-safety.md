# Safety, Consent & Kill Switch

## Core Safety Principle
This system is designed to assist humans, not replace them.

All outputs are suggestions only.
Humans always make final decisions.

---

## Consent
- Call recording and analysis only happen with explicit user consent
- No call data is stored or processed without permission
- Usage data is assumed to be anonymized or approved for analysis

---

## Human Control
- Reps can ignore any AI suggestion
- Managers can override AI recommendations
- No penalties for ignoring suggestions

---

## Kill Switch
A kill switch exists to immediately disable:
- All agents (global kill switch)
- Individual agents (per-agent kill switch)

When the kill switch is active:
- No suggestions are generated
- No automated actions are taken
- System safely degrades to manual mode

---

## Data Boundaries
- No sensitive personal data is shared externally
- AI does not make hiring, firing, or legal decisions
