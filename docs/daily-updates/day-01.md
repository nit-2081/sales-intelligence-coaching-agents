# Day 1 Update

## What was completed today
- Project repository initialized with clean structure
- Shared intelligence backbone documented
- Agent boundaries clearly defined
- Mock data created for:
  - Sales calls
  - Usage telemetry
  - Rep and customer profiles
- Safety, consent, and kill switch documented

## Key decisions
- One shared intelligence backbone reused by all agents
- AI provides suggestions only; humans remain in control
- Mock data used to avoid dependency on real systems

## Blockers
- None

## Plan for Day 2
- Architecture diagrams
- Shared component design
- Decide data flow between backbone and agents
